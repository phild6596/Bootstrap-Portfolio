                        one of your best hiring decisions in your life based on this portfolio. I started my journey into computers when I was a
                        small child, interested in learning about new ideas and concepts. The puzzle solving, the challenges, the unique relationship
                        every person in the world has with computers, I want to be a part of that. I was born in Mexico, raised in San Diego. I am
                        bilingual, and that has given me a slight advantage in understanding this new coding language. Computers aren't the only
                        interest of mine; I also play guitar, love camping, travel when I get a chance, and my most loved role, being a husband and
                        dad. I love tackling every single one of these because they all present their own unique challenge, a different way to see
                        things. I bring that perspective, a man who not only has seen things in his lifetime, but has enough experiences with them
                        to see things and solve problems while looking at them from every possible angle. That's what I bring, and that's what you'll
                        always have in me.
